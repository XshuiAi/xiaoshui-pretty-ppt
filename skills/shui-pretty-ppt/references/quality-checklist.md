# Quality Checklist

Use this before delivering a Shui Pretty PPT deck.

## P0 · Must Pass

- `index.html` exists in the output folder.
- The deck opens in a browser.
- No `[必填]`, `TODO`, `Lorem`, or obvious placeholder copy remains.
- The selected template is still visually recognizable.
- Text does not overlap navigation, page dots, fixed bars, or bottom controls.
- No slide-like page requires vertical scrolling to read core content.
- Local images/videos referenced by the HTML exist.
- Image paths are relative to the deck folder, not absolute `/Users/...` paths.
- The deck uses one template grammar; do not mix classes from unrelated templates.

## P1 · Content Quality

- The deck has a clear cover/title.
- It has a visible structure: agenda, chapter pages, section labels, or page markers.
- Long source material has been compressed into slide logic.
- Each page has a clear role: hook, context, data, process, comparison, case, summary, closing.
- Dense pages are grouped with labels, tables, cards, or visual hierarchy.
- Speaker deck pages are not overloaded with report paragraphs.

## P2 · Visual Quality

- The color system matches the chosen template.
- Typography hierarchy is clear: title, subtitle, body, metadata.
- Images have consistent aspect ratios in the same group.
- Important screenshots are legible at presentation size.
- No repeated generic card grid across every page unless the template intentionally uses it.
- Motion is restrained and does not hide content if scripts fail.

## P3 · Delivery

- Report the local path.
- Report the selected template.
- Mention the density level used.
- Mention any missing assets or assumptions.
- If publishing, package the final static folder only.
